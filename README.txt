SmartEnergyMine - Combined Frontend + Backend
===========================================

This package contains the backend (extracted from the uploaded zip) and a fresh, modern frontend in the 'frontend' folder.

Top-level files/folders extracted from backend zip:
[
  "requirements.txt",
  "README.md",
  "app"
]

How to run (typical):
1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Start the backend:
   - If it's a Node/Express app: `npm install` then `npm start` or `node index.js`.
   - If it's Python/Flask: create a venv, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then `python app.py`.
   - Check backend README inside the extracted backend files for exact steps.
3. Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser (or serve it with a local static server).
4. In the frontend UI, set API Base URL to your backend URL (e.g., http://localhost:5000) and click "Save & Test".

Notes:
- I couldn't run your backend in this environment (no long-lived servers). I inspected the zip and packaged the frontend to call common health endpoints:
  /api/health, /health, and /.
- If your backend uses a different port or path, update the API Base URL in the frontend.
